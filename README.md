## üéØ About The Project

Finding consolidated, reliable, and detailed information about postgraduate medical colleges in India is a significant challenge for aspirants. Information is often scattered across various websites, forums, and outdated documents. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a single, user-friendly platform that houses all the essential data points a medical PG student needs to make an informed decision.

Our mission is to empower medical students with the data they need, presented in a clean, accessible, and structured format.
